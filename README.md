# PixelClick
### Sketch it out.

PixelClick is a basic drawing app in React.js using the react-sketch package.

## Installation/Development

Use Ruby 2.3.3 and Rails 4.2.3.
To begin developing/tinkering with PixelClick, fork and clone this repo, then run:

```
$ bundle install
$ rake db:migrate
```

PixelClick in development mode uses Foreman to run the Rails API alongside a React.js front-end. To run your own local development server, run

```
$ rake start
```

You're off to the races!
